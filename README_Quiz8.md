## Quiz 8 
### Part1: Imaging Technique Inspiration
        Our projects draw inspiration from the fusion of digital and geometric art found in film and artwork.
        Digital rain in The Matrix and astral motion in Interstellar.
        I want to add these animation effects to our project.
        There is also the geometric art of Victor Vasarely, since the art chosen is also composed mainly of geometric shapes.
        By integrating these elements through p5.js technology, we aimed to bring a structured and animated quality to this major project, completing this project through interactive geometric design.

### Part2: Coding Technique Exploration
        To achieve the abstract and dynamic visual effects described in Part 1, we will make use of object-oriented programming (OOP) and array functions in p5.js.
        OOP will allow us to define classes for geometric shapes, providing each object with properties and behaviors that can be interacted with and animated on the canvas.
        For example, a class might represent the orbiting planets depicted in "Interstellar."
        Array functions will be able to manage collections of these objects, facilitating operations such as creation, sorting and animation, similar to the structured yet fluid nature of the digital rain in "The Matrix."
