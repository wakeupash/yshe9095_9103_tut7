# Claude Monet 'Saint Georges majeur au creÃÅpuscule'

# Instructions

1. **Fireworks**: Click on the screen to create fireworks. Each click will create a new firework at the mouse position.
2. **Firework Size**: Use the UP and DOWN arrow keys to increase or decrease the size of the fireworks.
3. **Firework Colour**: Press the ENTER key to change the colour of the fireworks.

## Details

### Approach

- **Interaction**: My individual task is to animate the User Input, especially the mouse clicks and keyboard inputs.

### Unique Aspects

- **Firework Creation**: I add a new component, 'fireworks', to the orginal image. Because I feel that changing the components in the original image will make it lose its original aesthetic. I think it can be made more visually appealing by adding fireworks.
- **Firework Animation**: The fireworks explode with changing colours and sizes based on user input.

### Inspiration

- **Fireworks Animation**: Inspired by the Disney fireworks.

## Technical Explanation

### Changes to Group Code

- **Added Fireworks**: Implement the fireworks that interacts with mouse clicks and keyboard inputs.
- **Graphics Buffer**: Create a  graphics buffer for drawing static elements to keep all the elements are working when I make the new animations.

### External Techniques

- **Fireworks**: Based on techniques from The Coding Train on Youtube ([The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKeyIbT3vXI)).
